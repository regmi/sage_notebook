"""
This script adapts import statements in sympy/mpmath/tests to work properly.

We want to have this fully automatic, so that we don't have to do it by hand
each time we copy files from mpmath to sympy.

Usage:

$ python bin/adapt_paths.py > /tmp/x
$ patch -p0 < /tmp/x

You can use the "--dry-run" parameter to 'patch' to see if all is ok and you
should also inspect the /tmp/x that all the changes generated are actually
correct.
